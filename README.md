- **Telemetry System**: OpenTelemetry monitoring for both interaction modes
- **Configuration Tools**: Built-in verification and voice preference management

This repository includes infrastructure as code and `Dockerfile` configurations to deploy the app to Azure Container Apps with separate containers for backend and API services, supporting both voice and text interaction patterns.

## Getting Started

You have a few options for getting started with this template. The quickest way to get started is [GitHub Codespaces](#github-codespaces), since it will setup all the tools for you, but you can also [set it up locally](#local-environment). You can also use a [VS Code dev container](#vs-code-dev-containers)

### GitHub Codespaces

You can run this repo virtually by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code in your browser:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=brightgreen&logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&skip_quickstart=true&machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=860141324&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json&geo=WestUs2)

Once the codespace opens (this may take several minutes), open a new terminal and proceed to [deploy the app](#deploying-the-app).

### VS Code Dev Containers

You can run the project in your local VS Code Dev Container using the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers):

1. Start Docker Desktop (install it if not already installed)
2. Open the project:

    [![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/azure-samples/aisearch-openai-rag-audio)
3. In the VS Code window that opens, once the project files show up (this may take several minutes), open a new terminal, and proceed to [deploying the app](#deploying-the-app).

### Local environment

1. Install the required tools:
   * [Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azure-dev/install)
   * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
   * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   * [Dev tools C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
   * [Python >=3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
      * **Important**: Python and the pip package manager must be in the path in Windows for the setup scripts to work.
      * **Important**: Ensure you can run `python --version` from console. On Ubuntu, you might need to run `sudo apt install python-is-python3` to link `python` to `python3`.
   * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   * [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) - For Windows users only.

2. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/olivMertens/gpt4oaudioVoiceRagApis.git`)
3. Proceed to the next section to [deploy the app](#deploying-the-app).

## Deploying the app

The steps below will provision Azure resources and deploy the **hybrid voice/text application** to Azure Container Apps.

1. Login to your Azure account:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

    For GitHub Codespaces users, if the previous command fails, try:

   ```shell
    azd auth login --use-device-code
    ```

1. Create a new azd environment:

    ```shell
    azd env new
    ```

    Enter a name that will be used for the resource group.
    This will create a new folder in the `.azure` folder, and set it as the active environment for any calls to `azd` going forward.

1. This is the point where you can customize the deployment by setting azd environment variables, in order to [use existing services](docs/existing_services.md) or [customize the voice choice](docs/customizing_deploy.md). For additional setup options and real-time features, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

1. Run this command to ensure that the [infrastructure](../infra/main.bicep) does not make a brand new OpenAI service:

    ```bash
    azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_REUSE_EXISTING true
    ```

2. Run this command to ensure that the [infrastructure](../infra/main.bicep) assigns the proper RBAC roles for accessing the OpenAI resource:

    ```bash
    azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_GROUP yourresourcegroupname
    ```

3. Run this command to point the app code at your Azure OpenAI endpoint:

    ```bash
    azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT https://cog-fbgwp5e2xzeezxwoo.openai.azure.com
    ```

4. Configure the Azure OpenAI deployments for both interaction modes:

    ```bash
    # Realtime API for voice interactions
    azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_DEPLOYMENT gpt-realtime
    azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_API_VERSION 2025-04-01-preview
    
    # GPT-Audio for text-to-speech
    azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_DEPLOYMENT gpt-audio
    azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION 2025-01-01-preview
    
    # Embedding model for RAG
    azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL text-embedding-3-large
    
    # Default voice (can be changed in UI)
    azd env set AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_VOICE_CHOICE alloy
    ```


5. Run this single command to provision the resources, deploy the code, and setup integrated vectorization for the sample data:

   ```shell
   azd up
   ````
   * **Important**: Beware that the resources created by this command will incur immediate costs, primarily from the AI Search resource. These resources may accrue costs even if you interrupt the command before it is fully executed. You can run `azd down` or delete the resources manually to avoid unnecessary spending.
   The delete could be long enough to delete the resources, so be patient.
   * **Important**: When deleting model deployments, they are moved to soft delete and stay in the subscription for 30 days. You can delete them permanently in the Azure portal in your Azure OpenAI resource. This is important because there are limits on the number of deployments and you can't create a new one if you reach the limit.
   Instead you could use the hard reset command `azd down --purge`

   ![screenshot soft delete aoai](docs/aoaisoftdelete.png)
   * You will be prompted to select two locations, one for the majority of resources and one for the OpenAI resource. The GPT real-time models are available for global deployments in East US 2 and Sweden Central regions only. For the most up-to-date information about quota and region availability, check the [Azure OpenAI Real-time documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/realtime-audio)
   * You can also update the quota for the model directly in Microsoft Foundry, in the Deployment section
   ![screenshot quota Ai foundry](docs/quotarealtime.png)

6. After the application has been successfully deployed you will see a URL printed to the console. Navigate to that URL to interact with the app in your browser. 

   **Two URLs will be provided:**
   - **API Service**: Test the API endpoints (add `/health` to check if the API is running)
   - **Main Application**: The hybrid voice/text insurance assistant interface
   
   **Testing Both Modes:**
   
   **Voice Chat Mode:**
   - Click "Voice Chat (Realtime)" tab
   - Click "Start conversation" button, say "Hello"
   - Ask questions like: "What types of insurance does Groupama offer?"

   **Text Chat Mode:**
   - Click "Text Chat (GPT-Audio)" tab
   - Type your question in the text field
   - Receive both text and audio responses
   
   **Voice Customization:**
   - Click the voice selector (🔊) to choose from 8 AI voices
   - Voice changes apply to both interaction modes
   - Try questions like:
      - "How do I file a claim with Groupama?"
       - "Find me a Groupama agency in Lyon"
      - "What's the contact number for Groupama customer service?"

You can also now run the app locally by following the instructions in [the next section](#development-server).

## Development local server

You can run this app locally using either the Azure services you provisioned by following the [deployment instructions](#deploying-the-app), or by pointing the local app at already [existing services](docs/existing_services.md).

### Prerequisites

Before running locally, you can verify your Azure OpenAI configuration using the included verification script:

```shell
python verify_config.py
```

This script validates:
- Endpoint format and connectivity
- API version compatibility
- Deployment name validation
- Model compatibility
- Environment variable setup
- WebSocket connection testing

### Environment Configuration

1. If you deployed with `azd up`, you should see a `app/backend/.env` file with the necessary environment variables.

2. If you did *not* use `azd up`, create `.env` file in the project root with the following environment variables:

   ```shell

   AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_API_VERSION=2025-04-01-preview
   AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_VOICE_CHOICE=alloy  # Options: alloy, ash, coral, echo, fable, nova, sage, shimmer
   AZURE_OPENAI_REALTIME_TRANSCRIPTION_LANGUAGE=fr  # fr for French, en for English

   # Azure OpenAI Configuration for GPT-Audio (Text-to-Speech)
   AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_ENDPOINT=https://<your-instance>.openai.azure.com
   AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-audio
   AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_API_VERSION=2025-01-01-preview
   AZURE_OPENAI_AUDIO_VOICE_CHOICE=alloy

   # Azure Search Configuration (for RAG)
   AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT=text-embedding-3-large
   AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://<your-service>.search.windows.net
   AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY=<your-search-api-key>
   AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX=voicerag-intvect
   AZURE_SEARCH_SEMANTIC_CONFIGURATION=default
   AZURE_SEARCH_IDENTIFIER_FIELD=chunk_id
   AZURE_SEARCH_CONTENT_FIELD=chunk
   AZURE_SEARCH_EMBEDDING_FIELD=text_vector
   AZURE_SEARCH_TITLE_FIELD=title
   AZURE_SEARCH_USE_VECTOR_QUERY=true

   # Application Configuration
   RUNNING_IN_PRODUCTION=false

   # Optional: Azure Authentication (if not using API keys)
   # AZURE_TENANT_ID=<your-tenant-id>
   ```

   **To use Entra ID** (your user when running locally, managed identity when deployed) simply don't set the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and `AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY`.

## Guidance

### Costs

The hybrid application uses two Azure OpenAI models which affects pricing:

* **Azure OpenAI**: 
  - **Realtime API**: Premium pricing for voice interactions, charged per audio minute
  - **GPT-Audio**: Standard pricing for text+audio generation, charged per token
  - **Embedding Model**: text-embedding-3-large for RAG functionality
  - [Pricing Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)

**Cost Optimization Tips:**
- Use **Text Mode** for simpler queries (more cost-effective)  
- Use **Voice Mode** for complex conversations requiring back-and-forth
- Voice selection doesn't impact costs - choose based on user preference

* Azure Container Apps: Consumption plan with 1 CPU core, 2.0 GB RAM. Pricing with Pay-as-You-Go. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/)
* Azure AI Search: Standard tier, 1 replica, free level of semantic search. Pricing per hour. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/)
* Azure Blob Storage: Standard tier with ZRS (Zone-redundant storage). Pricing per storage and read operations. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/blobs/)
* Azure Monitor: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

To reduce costs, you can switch to free SKUs for various services, but those SKUs have limitations.

⚠️ To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.
